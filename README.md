# 2D Tile-based Game Framework

## 1. Introduction

Many gamers recognize classic tile-based games such as Legend of Zelda(1986), Final Fantasy(1987), and Pokemon(1996) to be what ignited
their love for video games. To this day, popular games are still regularly released utilizing the tile-based game engine strategy. As a
software developer who's development career began due to his interest in game development, I was excited to try my hand at building a 2D
tile-based game myself, while learning and implementing effective programming practices in C++.

The tile-based game engine was originally developed so as to increase memory efficiency for game development, allowing for larger and more
complex games to be created for early video game consoles where memory came at a premium. Today, memory is of far less concern than in the early days of video game
development, but the tile-based engine remains popular: some gamers find the "retro" art appealing, while independent game developers,
in particular, can find the implementation to be simpler.

The engine works by having many of the game's tile images contained within a single image file, the texture atlas. The game engine is then
instructed to render these reusable portions of the texture atlas to create the game's play area, or tilemap, by "placing" the tiles in
their specified locations.
